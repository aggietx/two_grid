Sample code for paper https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/22M1502859

main_ex1.m main_ex2.m main_ex3.m are three examples with different permeability field.
Code is not 100% optimized. 
Running time for a 256^3 problem with a Intel(R) i7-1260P CPU (12 cores used for computing multiscale basis) is about 2 minutes, should start matlab 
parallel tool first.
